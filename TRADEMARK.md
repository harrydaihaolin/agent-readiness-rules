# Trademark policy

The code in this repository is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE). The
trademark policy below is **separate** from the copyright license and
governs use of the project name, logo, and identity.

## What is reserved

The following are reserved for the canonical agent-readiness project:

- The name **agent-readiness** (and the abbreviated form **ar**) when
  used as a product name, package name on a public registry,
  organisation name, hosted-service name, or social-media handle.
- The agent-readiness wordmark and "ar" badge logo as they appear in
  this repo's `README.md` and on the public landing page.
- The names of the official distribution surfaces:
  `agent-readiness-mcp`, `agent-readiness-claude-skill`,
  `agent-readiness-vscode`, `agent-readiness-gh-extension`,
  `agent-readiness-pre-commit`, and `agent-readiness-action`.

## What forks and derivatives may do

You can fork the code, run it offline, embed it, vendor it, and
redistribute modified versions under the terms of the MIT license.
What you cannot do is keep the agent-readiness name and logo while
shipping a divergent product. Specifically:

- A fork that diverges from this repository must use a clearly
  distinct name on its package registry, repo title, and any hosted
  surface.
- A fork must remove the wordmark and badge logo from its README
  and from any UI it ships.
- A hosted service ("X-as-a-Service" running this code) must not
  call itself "agent-readiness", "agent-readiness Cloud",
  "agent-readiness Pro", or any close variant.
- Marketing copy and search-engine listings for a fork must not
  imply official endorsement.

## What forks and derivatives are encouraged to do

- Cite this repository and the rule pack version they vendored.
- Preserve the `provenance:` field on every rule they redistribute.
  See [`LICENSE-NOTICES.md`](LICENSE-NOTICES.md) for the attribution
  expectations that make community contribution sustainable.
- Open a PR upstream when a rule, fix, or improvement is broadly
  useful. The pack is MIT specifically so good ideas can come back.

## What's not a trademark issue

- Writing "we use agent-readiness" or "scored 92 on agent-readiness"
  in a blog post, a README, or a job listing is fine.
- Mentioning the project's score in marketing material, when it
  reflects an honest run of the unmodified scanner, is fine.
- A community plugin, dashboard, or visualisation that integrates
  with the official scanner via documented APIs may use
  "for agent-readiness" in its description (e.g.
  "scoreboard-for-agent-readiness").

## Reporting concerns

If you see a project using the agent-readiness name in a way that
implies official affiliation or endorsement, open an issue on this
repository or email the maintainers (see [`README.md`](README.md)).
We aim to resolve trademark issues with a friendly request before
escalating.

## Why this exists

The scanner and rules pack are MIT precisely so the community can
build, fork, and redistribute. The name carries a reputation for
running cleanly and reporting calibrated scores; muddying that name
with a divergent fork hurts users who think they're getting the
canonical signal. The trademark policy is the mechanism that keeps
the signal clean while the code stays free.
